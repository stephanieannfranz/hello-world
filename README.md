Steph here - 

Trying to do what most humans want - to life a happy, fulfilled life. For some, that means buying a house and spending 10+ years with one company. For others, that means getting married and having children.

For me, the life I want is one of few committments and the ability to hop on the road whenever I want. The income-generator I want is one that challenges me and allows me to create tangible (wrong word - the web is not tangible) things. What can I do to reach this life? Learn to code, learn web development, learn the skills that will allow me to work from anywhere.
